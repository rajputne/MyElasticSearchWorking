 If since the beginning of any such Test Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged , amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such Test Period shall have made any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.04 , then any applicable financial ratio or test shall be calculated giving pro forma effect thereto for such period as if such Specified Transaction occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period .

 Section 2.12 Payments Generally .
 -LRB- a -RRB- Except as otherwise required by applicable Law , all payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim , defense , recoupment or setoff .
 Except as otherwise expressly provided herein , all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent , for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed , at the Administrative Agent 's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein .
 The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share -LRB- or other applicable share as provided herein -RRB- of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender 's Lending Office .
 All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 4:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day in the Administrative Agent 's sole discretion and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue to the extent applicable .
 -LRB- b -RRB- If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day , payment shall be made on the next following Business Day , and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees , as the case may be ; provided that , if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month , such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day .
 -LRB- c -RRB- Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent , prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder , that the Borrower or such Lender , as the case may be , will not make such payment , the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender , as the case may be , has timely made such 83 payment and may -LRB- but shall not be so required to -RRB- , in reliance thereon , make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto .
 If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds , then : -LRB- i -RRB- if the Borrower failed to make such payment , each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds , together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the applicable Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect ; and -LRB- ii -RRB- if any Lender failed to make such payment , such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds , together with interest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent -LRB- the `` Compensation Period '' -RRB- at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect .
 When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent -LRB- together with all accrued interest thereon -RRB- , then such payment amount -LRB- excluding the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment -RRB- shall constitute such Lender 's Loan included in the applicable Borrowing .
 If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent 's demand therefor , the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Borrower , and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent , together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing .
 Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any Default by such Lender hereunder .
 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.12 -LRB- c -RRB- shall be conclusive , absent manifest error .
 -LRB- d -RRB- If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article 2 , and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article 4 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof , the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds -LRB- in like funds as received from such Lender -RRB- to such Lender , without interest .
 -LRB- e -RRB- The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line Loans are several and not joint .
 The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date , and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or purchase its participation .
 84 -LRB- f -RRB- Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner .
 -LRB- g -RRB- Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date , such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of priority set forth in Section 8.03 .
 If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied , the Administrative Agent may , but shall not be obligated to , elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender 's Pro Rata Share of the sum of -LRB- i -RRB- the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and -LRB- ii -RRB- the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations outstanding at such time , in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender .

 Reorganization Securities .
 If , in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding , debt obligations of the reorganized debtor secured by Liens upon any property of the reorganized debtor are distributed , pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan , on account of both the Senior Obligations and the Second Priority Debt Obligations , then , to the extent the debt obligations distributed on account of the Senior Obligations and on account of the Second Priority Debt Obligations are secured by Liens upon the same assets or property , the provisions of this Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply with like effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations .
