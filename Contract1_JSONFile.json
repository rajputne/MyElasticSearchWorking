(b) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and   obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for   purposes of this Section 10.07(b), participations in L/C Obligations and in Swing Line Loans) at the time owing to   it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender\u2019s   Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a   Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this   purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the   outstanding principal balance of the Loan of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of   the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent   shall not be less than $5,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, or   $1,000,000, in the case of any assignment in respect of any Term Loans (provided, however, that concurrent   assignments to or by Approved Funds will be treated as a single assignment for the purpose of meeting the minimum   transfer requirements); (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender (or, in respect of any Revolving Credit   Facility, a Revolving Credit Lender), an Affiliate of a Lender (or, in respect of any Revolving Credit Facility, a   Revolving Credit Lender) or an Approved Fund (but subject to clause (iv) below), each of the Administrative Agent   and, so long as no Event of Default in respect of Section 8.01(a), Section 8.01(f) or Section 8.01(g)(i) has occurred   and is continuing and the Loans shall have been declared immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 8.02, the   Borrower consents to such assignment (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided   that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment of Term Loans (other than to a   Competitor) unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within five (5) Business   Days after having received notice thereof; (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a   proportionate part of all the assigning Lender\u2019s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to the   Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (iii) shall not (x) apply to rights in respect of Swing Line   Loans or (y) prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate   Facilities on a non-pro rata basis; (iv) any assignment of a Revolving Credit Commitment must be approved by the   Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender (each such consent not to be unreasonably   withheld or delayed); (v) the parties (other than the Borrower unless its consent to such assignment is required   hereunder) to each assignment shall (A) execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and   Assumption via an electronic settlement system acceptable to the Administrative Agent (which initially shall be   ClearPar, LLC) or (B) manually execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption   together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which fee (x) the Borrower shall not have an obligation to   pay except as required in Section 3.07 and (y) may be waived by the Administrative Agent in its discretion);   provided       165      that only a single processing and recordation fee shall be payable in respect of multiple contemporaneous   assignments to Approved Funds with respect to any Lender; (vi) the assigning Lender shall deliver any Notes   evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and (vii) each assignment by an Affiliated   Lender shall be acknowledged by the Borrower. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative   Agent pursuant to Section 10.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption,   the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such   Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning     Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from   its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the   assigning Lender\u2019s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but   shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01, Section 3.04, Section 3.05, Section 10.04 and   Section 10.05 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon   request, and the surrender by the assigning Lender of its Note, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and   deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this   Agreement that does not comply with this clause (b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by   such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 10.07(e).    (c) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the   Administrative Agent\u2019s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the   recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and related   interest amounts) of the Loans, L/C Obligations (specifying the Unreimbursed Amounts), L/C Borrowings and   amounts due under Section 2.03, owing to each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the   \u201cRegister\u201d). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agents and   the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as the owner   of its interests in the Loans, L/C Obligations, L/C Borrowings and amounts due under the Loan Documents as set   forth in the Register and as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the   contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Agent, any Lender (with respect to   such Lender\u2019s interest) and the L/C Issuer, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior   notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Credit Extensions and Obligations   are intended to be treated as registered obligations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any right or title in or to   any Credit Extensions and Obligations (including with respect to the principal amount and any interest thereon) may   only be assigned or otherwise transferred through the Register. This Section 10.07 shall be construed so that the   Credit Extensions and Obligations are at all times maintained in \u201cregistered form\u201d within the meaning of Sections   163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code, Treasury Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c) and any other related   regulations (or any successor provisions of the Code or such regulations).    (d) The words \u201cexecution,\u201d \u201csigned,\u201d \u201csignature\u201d and words of like import in any Assignment and   Assumption shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of   which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability       166      as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent   and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National   Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act or any other similar state laws based on   the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.    (e) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative   Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or a Competitor) (each, a \u201cParticipant\u201d) in all   or a portion of such Lender\u2019s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its   Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender\u2019s participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans)   owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender\u2019s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such   Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and   (iii) the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in   connection with such Lender\u2019s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant   to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this   Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision   of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such   Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification   described in the clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the second proviso to Section 10.01 that directly affects such Participant.   Subject to Section 10.07(f), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 3.01, Section 3.04 and Section 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein and in Sections 3.06   and 10.15 read as if a Participant was a Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest   by assignment pursuant to Section 10.07(b) and such Participant agrees to be bound by such Sections and     Section 3.06. To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.09   as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a   Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an non-fiduciary agent of the   Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts   (and stated interest) of each Participant\u2019s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the   \u201cParticipant Register\u201d). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such   Lender (and the Borrower, to the extent that the Participant requests payment from the Borrower) shall treat each   person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this   Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. The portion of the Participant Register relating to any   Participant requesting payment from the Borrower under the Loan Documents shall be made available to the   Borrower upon reasonable request.    (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, Section 3.04 or   Section 3.05 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to   such Participant, except to the extent that any entitlement to a greater payment results from a Change in Law arising   after such Participant became a Participant.       167      (g) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative   Agent, pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its   Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a   Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no such pledge or   assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or   assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.    (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a \u201cGranting Lender\u201d) may grant   to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the   Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an \u201cSPC\u201d) the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such   Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein   shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or   otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan   pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) such SPC and the applicable Loan or any applicable part thereof, shall be   appropriately reflected in the Register. Each party hereto hereby agrees that an SPC shall be entitled to the benefits   of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein and in Sections 3.06 and 10.15),   but (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses   or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including their obligations   under Section 3.01, Section 3.04 or Section 3.05), except to the extent that any entitlement to a greater payment   under Section 3.01, 3.04 or 3.05 results from a Change in Law arising after the grant to such SPC, (ii) no SPC shall   be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable,   and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other   modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder. The making of a Loan   by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan   were made by such Granting Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, subject to   compliance with the provisions of this Section 10.07 regarding the Register and/or the Participant Register, as   appropriate, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent   and with the payment of a processing fee of $3,500, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with   respect to any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information   relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or   Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.    (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender that is a Fund may, without the   consent of or notice to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, create a security interest in all or any portion of   the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for holders of obligations owed, or securities   issued, by such Fund as security for such obligations or securities; provided that unless and until such trustee   actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this Section 10.07, (i) no such pledge shall     release the pledging Lender from any of its obligations under the Loan Documents and, (ii) such trustee shall not be   entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even       168      though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the pledged interest through foreclosure or   otherwise (unless such trustee is an Eligible Assignee which has complied with the requirements of   Section 10.07(b)).    (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Barclays Bank PLC may, upon thirty (30) days\u2019   notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or the Swing Line Lender; provided that on or prior   to the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period with respect to Barclays Bank PLC\u2019s resignation as L/C Issuer,   Barclays Bank PLC shall have identified a successor L/C Issuer reasonably acceptable to the Borrower willing to   accept its appointment as successor L/C Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line   Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders willing to accept such appointment a   successor L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder; provided that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such   successor shall affect the resignation of Barclays Bank PLC as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be,   except as expressly provided above. If Barclays Bank PLC resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights and   obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its   resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to   make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). If   Barclays Bank PLC resigns as Swing Line Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for   hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation,   including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing   Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c).    (k) (i) Notwithstanding the definition of \u201cEligible Assignee\u201d or anything else to the contrary contained in this   Agreement, any Lender may assign all or a portion of its Term Loans to any Person who, after giving effect to such   assignment, would be an Affiliated Lender (without the consent of any Person but subject to acknowledgment by the   Administrative Agent and the Borrower); provided that:    (A) the assigning Lender and the Affiliated Lender purchasing such Lender\u2019s Term Loans shall execute   and deliver to the Administrative Agent an assignment agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit R hereto   (an \u201cAffiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption\u201d);    (B) for the avoidance of doubt, Lenders shall not be permitted to assign Revolving Credit Commitments   or Revolving Credit Loans to an Affiliated Lender and any purported assignment of Revolving Credit   Commitments or Revolving Credit Loans to an Affiliated Lender shall be null and void; and    (C) at the time of such assignment after giving affect to such assignment, the aggregate principal amount   of all Loans held by Affiliated Lenders shall not exceed 25% of the aggregate principal amount of all Loans   and Commitments outstanding under this Agreement.    (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Affiliated Lender shall have any right to   (A) attend (including by telephone) any meeting or discussions (or portion       169      thereof) among the Administrative Agent or any Lender to which representatives of the Loan Parties are not invited,   or (B) receive any information or material prepared by Administrative Agent or any Lender or any communication   by or among Administrative Agent and/or one or more Lenders, except to the extent such information or materials   have been made available to any Loan Party or its representatives.    (iii) Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.01 or the definition of \u201cRequired Lenders\u201d to the contrary, for   purposes of determining whether the Required Lenders, all affected Lenders or all Lenders have (A) consented (or   not consented) to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of   any Loan Document or any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, (B) otherwise acted on any matter related to any   Loan Document, or (C) directed or required the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or   refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under any Loan Document, an Affiliated Lender shall be deemed     to have voted its interest as a Lender without discretion in the same proportion as the allocation of voting with   respect to such matter by Lenders who are not Affiliated Lenders; provided that no amendment, modification,   waiver, consent or other action with respect to any Loan Document shall deprive such Affiliated Lender of its Pro   Rata Share of any payments to which such Affiliated Lender is entitled under the Loan Documents without such   Affiliated Lender providing its consent; provided, further, that such Affiliated Lender shall have the right to approve   any amendment, modification, waiver or consent of the type described in Section 10.01 (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this   Agreement to the extent that such Affiliated Lender is affected thereby; and in furtherance of the foregoing, (x) the   Affiliated Lender agrees to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent any instrument reasonably requested by   the Administrative Agent to evidence the voting of its interest as a Lender in accordance with the provisions of this   Section 10.07(k); provided that if the Affiliated Lender fails to promptly execute such instrument such failure shall   in no way prejudice any of the Administrative Agent\u2019s rights under this paragraph and (y) the Administrative Agent   is hereby appointed (such appointment being coupled with an interest) by the Affiliated Lender as the Affiliated   Lender\u2019s attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of the Affiliated Lender and in the name of the   Affiliated Lender, from time to time in Administrative Agent\u2019s discretion to take any action and to execute any   instrument that Administrative Agent may deem reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this   paragraph (k)(iii).    (iv) Each Affiliated Lender, solely in its capacity as a Term Lender, hereby agrees, and each Affiliated Lender   Assignment Agreement shall provide a confirmation that, if any Company Party shall be subject to any voluntary or   involuntary proceeding commenced under any Debtor Relief Laws (\u201cBankruptcy Proceedings\u201d), (i) such Affiliated   Lender shall not take any step or action in such Bankruptcy Proceeding to object to, impede, or delay the exercise of   any right or the taking of any action by the Administrative Agent (or the taking of any action by a third party that is   supported by the Administrative Agent) in relation to such Affiliated Lender\u2019s claim with respect to its Loans (a   \u201cClaim\u201d) (including, without limitation, objecting to any debtor in possession financing, use of cash collateral, grant   of adequate protection, sale or disposition, compromise, or plan of reorganization) so long as such Affiliated Lender   is treated in connection with such exercise or action on the same or better terms as the other Term Lenders and   (ii) with respect to any matter requiring the vote of Term Lenders during the pendency of a Bankruptcy Proceeding   (including, without limitation, voting on any plan of reorganization), the       170      Loans held by such Affiliated Lender (and any Claim with respect thereto) shall be deemed to be voted in   accordance with clause (iii) of this Section 10.07(k), so long as such Affiliate Lender is treated in connection with   the exercise of such right or taking of such action on the same or better terms as the other Term Lenders. For the   avoidance of doubt, the Lenders and each Affiliated Lender agree and acknowledge that the provisions set forth in   this clause (iv) of Section 10.07(k), and the related provisions set forth in each Affiliated Lender Assignment and   Assumption, constitute a \u201csubordination agreement\u201d as such term is contemplated by, and utilized in, Section 510(a)   of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and, as such, would be enforceable for all purposes in any case where a   Company Party has filed for protection under any Debtor Relief Law applicable to such Company Party.    The foregoing provisions of this Section 10.07(k) shall not apply to an Investment Fund, and a Lender shall be   permitted to assign all or a portion of such Lender\u2019s Loans to any Investment Fund without regard to the foregoing   provisions of this Section 10.07(k).    (l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.07 or any other provision of this   Agreement (including Section 2.05), so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or   would result therefrom, any of the Company Parties may prepay outstanding Term Loans on the following basis:    (i) a Company Party shall have the right to make a voluntary prepayment of the Term Loans at a   discount to par (such prepayment, the \u201cDiscounted Term Loan Prepayment\u201d) pursuant to, at each Company   Party\u2019s sole option, a Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment, Borrower Solicitation of Discount   Range Prepayment Offers, Borrower Solicitation of Discounted Prepayment Offers, in each case made in   accordance with this Section 10.07(l); provided, (A) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to   any such Discounted Term Loan Prepayment by the Borrower or Loan Party, the sum of (x) the unused   Revolving Credit Commitments and (y) the amount of unrestricted cash and Cash Equivalents of the Borrower   and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be not less than $30,000,000, (B) any such Discounted Term Loan   Prepayment shall be financed by the Company Party with Internally Generated Cash Flow or with Eligible     Equity Proceeds or the proceeds of Permitted Subordinated Indebtedness, in each case that are Not Otherwise   Applied and (C) the Company Party shall not initiate any actions under this Section 10.07 in order to make a   Discounted Term Loan Prepayment unless (1) at least five (5) Business Days shall have passed since the   consummation of the most recent Discounted Term Loan Prepayment as a result of a prepayment made by the   Company Party on the applicable Discounted Prepayment Effective Date and (2) at least three (3) Business   Days shall have passed since the consummation of the most recent Discounted Term Loan Prepayment due to   no Term Lender being willing to accept any prepayment of any Term Loans at the Specified Discount, within   the Discount Range or at any discount to par value, as applicable, or in the case of Borrower Solicitation of   Discounted Prepayment Offers, the Borrower\u2019s election not to accept any Solicited Discounted Prepayment   Offers made by a Term Lender.    (ii) (A) Subject to Section 10.07(l)(i), a Company Party may from time to time offer to make a   Discounted Term Loan Prepayment by providing the Auction Agent irrevocable notice in the form of a   Specified Discount Prepayment Notice; provided that       171      (1) any such offer shall be made available to each Term Lender, (2) any such offer shall specify the aggregate   principal amount offered to be prepaid (the \u201cSpecified Discount Prepayment Amount\u201d) and the specific   percentage discount to par value (the \u201cSpecified Discount\u201d) of the principal amount of such Loans to be   prepaid, (3) the Specified Discount Prepayment Amount shall be in a minimum amount of $2,000,000 and   whole increments of $500,000, and (4) each such offer shall remain outstanding through the Specified   Discount Prepayment Response Date. The Auction Agent will promptly provide each Term Lender with a   copy of such Specified Discount Prepayment Notice and a form of the Specified Discount Prepayment   Response to be completed and returned by each Lender to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by no later than   5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to the Term   Lenders (the \u201cSpecified Discount Prepayment Response Date\u201d).    (B) Each Term Lender shall notify the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by the Specified Discount   Prepayment Response Date whether or not it agrees to accept a prepayment of any of its then outstanding   Term Loans at the Specified Discount and, if so (such accepting Lender, a \u201cDiscount Prepayment Accepting   Lender\u201d), the amount of such Lender\u2019s outstanding principal amount of such offered discounted prepayment   to be prepaid. Each acceptance of a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment by a Discount Prepayment Accepting   Lender shall be irrevocable. Any Term Lender whose Specified Discount Prepayment Notice is not received   by the Auction Agent by the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined   to accept the Borrower Offer of Specified Discount Prepayment.    (C) If there is at least one Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender, the Company Party will prepay   outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this Section 10.07(l)(ii) to each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender   in accordance with the principal amount specified in such Lender\u2019s Specified Discount Prepayment Response   given pursuant to the foregoing clause (B); provided that, if the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans   accepted for prepayment by all Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders exceeds the Specified Discount   Prepayment Amount, such prepayment shall be made pro rata among the Discount Prepayment Accepting   Lenders in accordance with the principal amount accepted by each such Discount Prepayment Accepting   Lender and the Auction Agent (in consultation with the Company Party and subject to rounding requirements   of the Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) will calculate such pro rata factor (the \u201cSpecified   Discount Pro-Rata Factor\u201d). The Auction Agent shall promptly, and in any case within five (5) Business   Days following the Specified Discount Prepayment Response Date, notify (1) such Company Party of the   Term Lenders\u2019 responses to such offer, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, and the aggregate   principal amount and Type of Loans of the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, (2) each Term Lender of the   Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, and the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans to be prepaid at   the Specified Discount on such date, and (3) each Discount Prepayment Accepting Lender of the Specified   Discount Pro-Rata Factor, if any, and confirmation of the principal amount and Type of Loans of such Lender   to be prepaid at the Specified Discount on such date. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of the   amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Company Party and Lenders shall be conclusive       172         and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The payment amount specified in such notice to the   Company Party shall be due and payable by the Company Party on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date   in accordance with Section 10.07(l)(vi) below.    (iii) (A) Subject to Section 10.07(l)(i), a Company Party may from time to time solicit Discount Range   Prepayment Offers by providing the Auction Agent with three (3) Business Days\u2019 irrevocable notice in the   form of a Discount Range Prepayment Notice; provided that (1) any such solicitation shall be extended to each   Term Lender, (2) any such notice shall specify the maximum aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans   (the \u201cDiscount Range Prepayment Amount\u201d) and the maximum and minimum percentage discounts to par   (the \u201cDiscount Range\u201d) of the principal amount of such Term Loans willing to be prepaid by the Company   Party, (3) the Discount Range Prepayment Amount shall be in a minimum amount of $2,000,000 and whole   increments of $500,000, and (4) each such solicitation by a Company Party shall remain outstanding through   the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date. The Auction Agent will promptly provide each Term Lender   with a copy of such Discount Range Prepayment Notice and a form of the Discount Range Prepayment Offer   to be submitted by a responding Term Lender to the Auction Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 p.m.,   Eastern time, on the third Business Day after the date of delivery of such notice to the Term Lenders (the   \u201cDiscount Range Prepayment Response Date\u201d). Each Term Lender\u2019s Discount Range Prepayment Offer   shall be irrevocable and shall specify a discount as a percentage of par within the Discount Range (the   \u201cSubmitted Discount\u201d) at which such Term Lender is willing to allow prepayment of its then outstanding   Term Loans and the maximum aggregate principal amount of such Term Loans (the \u201cSubmitted Amount\u201d)   such Lender is willing to have prepaid at the Submitted Discount. Any Term Lender whose Discount Range   Prepayment Offer is not received by the Auction Agent by the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date   shall be deemed to have declined to accept a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment of any of its Term Loans at   any discount to their par value within the Discount Range.    (B) The Auction Agent shall review all Discount Range Prepayment Offers received by it by the   Discount Range Prepayment Response Date and will determine (in consultation with the Company Party and   subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) the Applicable   Discount and the Term Loans to be prepaid at such Applicable Discount in accordance with this   Section 10.07. The Company Party agrees to accept on the Discount Range Prepayment Response Date all   Discount Range Prepayment Offers received by Auction Agent by the Discount Range Prepayment Response   Date, in the order from lowest Submitted Discount to highest Submitted Discount, up to and including the   lowest Submitted Discount within the Discount Range (such lowest Submitted Discount being referred to as   the \u201cApplicable Discount\u201d) which yields a Discounted Term Loan Prepayment in an aggregate principal   amount equal to the lower of (1) the Discount Range Prepayment Amount and (2) the sum of all Submitted   Amounts. Each Lender that has submitted a Discount Range Prepayment Offer to accept prepayment at a   percentage of par value that is less than or equal to the Applicable Discount shall be deemed to have   irrevocably consented to prepayment       173      of Term Loans equal to its Submitted Amount (subject to any required pro-rating pursuant to the following   sentence) at the Applicable Discount (each such Lender, a \u201cParticipating Lender\u201d).    (C) If there is at least one Participating Lender, the Company Party will prepay outstanding Term Loans   pursuant to this Section 10.07(l)(iii) to each Participating Lender in the aggregate principal amount specified   in such Lender\u2019s Discount Range Prepayment Offer at the Applicable Discount; provided that if the Submitted   Amount by all Participating Lenders offered at or below the Applicable Discount exceeds the Discounted   Prepayment Range Amount, prepayment of the principal amount of the Term Loans for those Participating   Lenders whose Submitted Discount is less than or equal to the Applicable Discount (the \u201cIdentified   Participating Lenders\u201d) shall be made pro rata among the Identified Participating Lenders in accordance   with the Submitted Amount of each such Identified Participating Lender and the Auction Agent (in   consultation with the Borrower and subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its sole   reasonable discretion) will calculate such pro rata factor (the \u201cDiscount Range Pro-Rata Factor\u201d). The   Auction Agent shall promptly, and in any case within five (5) Business Days following the Discount Range   Prepayment Response Date, notify (w) the Company Party of the Term Lenders\u2019 responses to such   solicitation, the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the aggregate principal   amount and Type of Loans of the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, (x) each Term Lender of the     Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, the Applicable Discount, and the aggregate principal amount of all   Term Loans to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on such date, (y) each Participating Lender of the   aggregate principal amount and Type of Loans of such Lender to be prepaid at the Applicable Discount on   such date, and (z) if applicable, each Identified Participating Lender of the Discount Range Pro-Rata Factor.   Each determination by the Auction Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Company Party   and Lenders shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The payment amount   specified in such notice to the Company Party shall be due and payable by the Borrower on the Discounted   Prepayment Effective Date in accordance with Section 10.07(l)(vi) below.    (iv) (A) Subject to Section 10.07(l)(i), a Company Party may from time to time solicit Solicited   Discounted Prepayment Offers by providing the Auction Agent with three (3) Business Days\u2019 irrevocable   notice in the form of a Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice; provided that (1) any such solicitation shall   be extended to each Term Lender, (2) any such notice shall specify the maximum aggregate principal amount   of the Term Loans (the \u201cSolicited Discounted Prepayment Amount\u201d) the Company Party is willing to   prepay at a discount, (3) the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount shall be in a minimum amount of   $2,000,000 and whole increments of $500,000, and (4) each such solicitation by the Company Party shall   remain outstanding through the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date. The Auction Agent will   promptly provide each Term Lender with a copy of such Solicited Discounted Prepayment Notice and a form   of the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer to be submitted by a responding Term Lender to the Auction   Agent (or its delegate) by no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time on the third Business Day after the date of   delivery of such notice to the Term Lenders (the \u201cSolicited       174      Discounted Prepayment Response Date\u201d). Each Term Lender\u2019s Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer   shall (x) be irrevocable, (y) remain outstanding until the Acceptance Date, and (z) specify both a discount as a   percentage of par (the \u201cOffered Discount\u201d) at which such Term Lender is willing to allow prepayment of its   then outstanding Term Loans and the maximum aggregate principal amount of such Term Loans (the   \u201cOffered Amount\u201d) such Lender is willing to have prepaid at the Offered Discount. Any Term Lender whose   Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer is not received by the Auction Agent by the Solicited Discounted   Prepayment Response Date shall be deemed to have declined prepayment of any of its Term Loans at any   discount to their par value.    (B) The Auction Agent shall promptly provide the Company Party with a copy of all Solicited   Discounted Prepayment Offers received by it by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date. The   Company Party shall review all such Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers and select, at its sole discretion,   the lowest of the Offered Discounts specified by the responding Term Lenders in the Solicited Discounted   Prepayment Offers that the Company Party is willing to accept (the \u201cAcceptable Discount\u201d), if any; provided,   however, that the Acceptable Discount shall not be an Offered Discount that is higher than the lowest Offered   Discount for which the sum of each Offered Amount affiliated with an Offered Discount that is less than or   equal to such percentage of par yields an amount at least equal to the Solicited Discounted Prepayment   Amount. If the Company Party elects to accept any Offered Discount as the Acceptable Discount, then as soon   as practicable after the determination of the Acceptable Discount, but in no event later than by the third   Business Day after the date of receipt by the Borrower from the Auction Agent of a copy of all Solicited   Discounted Prepayment Offers pursuant to the first sentence of this clause (B) (the \u201cAcceptance Date\u201d), the   Company Party shall submit an irrevocable Acceptance and Prepayment Notice to the Auction Agent setting   forth the Acceptable Discount. If the Auction Agent shall fail to receive an Acceptance and Prepayment   Notice from the Company Party by the Acceptance Date, the Company Party shall be deemed to have rejected   all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers.    (C) Based upon the Acceptable Discount and the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received by   Auction Agent by the Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date, within five (5) Business Days after   receipt of an Acceptance and Prepayment Notice (the \u201cDiscounted Prepayment Determination Date\u201d), the   Auction Agent will determine (in consultation with the Company Party and subject to rounding requirements   of the Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable discretion) the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans   (the \u201cAcceptable Prepayment Amount\u201d) to be prepaid by the Company Party at the Acceptable Discount in   accordance with this Section 10.07. If the Company Party elects to accept any Acceptable Discount, then the   Company Party agrees to accept all Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offers received by Auction Agent by the     Solicited Discounted Prepayment Response Date, in the order from lowest Offered Discount to highest   Offered Discount, up to and including the Acceptable Discount. Each Lender that has submitted a Solicited   Discounted Prepayment Offer to accept prepayment at a percentage of par value that is less than or equal to   the Acceptable Discount shall be deemed to have irrevocably consented to prepayment of Term Loans equal   to its Offered       175      Amount (subject to any required pro-rationing pursuant to the following sentence) at the Acceptable Discount   (each such Lender, a \u201cQualifying Lender\u201d). The Company Party will prepay outstanding Term Loans   pursuant to this Section 10.07(l)(iv) to each Qualifying Lender in the aggregate principal amount specified in   such Lender\u2019s Solicited Discounted Prepayment Offer at the Acceptable Discount; provided that if the   aggregate Offered Amount by all Qualifying Lenders at or below the Acceptable Discount exceeds the   Solicited Discounted Prepayment Amount, prepayment of the principal amount of the Term Loans for those   Qualifying Lenders whose Offered Discount is less than or equal to the Acceptable Discount (the \u201cIdentified   Qualifying Lenders\u201d) shall be made pro rata among the Identified Qualifying Lenders in accordance with the   Offered Amount of each such Identified Qualifying Lender and the Auction Agent (in consultation with the   Company Party and subject to rounding requirements of the Auction Agent made in its sole reasonable   discretion) will calculate such pro rata factor (the \u201cSolicited Discount Pro-Rata Factor\u201d). On or prior to the   Discounted Prepayment Determination Date, the Auction Agent shall promptly notify (w) the Company Party   of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date, Acceptable Prepayment Amount and Type of Loans comprising   the Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, (x) each Term Lender of the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date,   the Acceptable Discount, and the Acceptable Prepayment Amount of all Term Loans to be prepaid at the   Applicable Discount on such date, (y) each Qualifying Lender of the aggregate principal amount and Type of   Loans of such Lender to be prepaid at the Acceptable Discount on such date, and (z) if applicable, each   Identified Qualifying Lender of the Solicited Discount Pro-Rata Factor. Each determination by the Auction   Agent of the amounts stated in the foregoing notices to the Company Party and Lenders shall be conclusive   and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The payment amount specified in such notice to the   Company Party shall be due and payable by the Company Party on the Discounted Prepayment Effective Date   in accordance with Section 10.07(l)(vi) below.    (v) If any Term Loans are prepaid in accordance with paragraphs (ii) through (iv) of this   Section 10.07(l), the Company Party shall prepay such Term Loans on the Discounted Prepayment Effective   Date. The Company Party shall make such prepayment to Auction Agent, for the account of the Discount   Prepayment Accepting Lenders, Participating Lenders, or Qualifying Lenders, as applicable, at the Auction   Agent\u2019s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 11:00 a.m. on the Discounted   Prepayment Effective Date. All Term Loans so prepaid by the Company Party shall be accompanied by all   accrued and unpaid interest on the par principal amount so prepaid up to, but not including, the Discounted   Prepayment Effective Date. Each prepayment of the outstanding Term Loans pursuant to this Section 10.07(l)   shall be paid to the Discount Prepayment Accepting Lenders, Participating Lenders, or Qualifying Lenders, as   applicable.    (vi) To the extent not expressly provided for herein, each Discounted Term Loan Prepayment shall be   consummated pursuant to procedures (including as to Type and Interest Periods of Term Loans to be so   prepaid) established by the Auction Agent acting in its reasonable discretion in consultation with the Company   Parties.       176      (vii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of this Section 10.07(l), each notice   or other communication required to be delivered or otherwise provided to the Auction Agent (or its delegate)   shall be deemed to have been given upon Auction Agent\u2019s (or its delegate\u2019s) actual receipt during normal   business hours of such notice or communication; provided that any notice or communication actually received   outside of normal business hours shall be deemed to have been given as of the opening of business on the next   business day for the Auction Agent.    (viii) Each of the Company Parties and the Lenders acknowledges and agrees that Auction Agent may   perform any and all of its duties under this Section 10.07(l) by itself or through any Agent Related Person of     the Auction Agent and expressly consents to any such delegation of duties by the Auction Agent to such   Agent Related Person and the performance of such delegated duties by the Agent Related Person. The   exculpatory provisions pursuant to this Agreement shall apply to each Agent Related Person of the Auction   Agent and their respective activities in connection with any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment provided for   in this Section 10.07(l) as well as activities of the Auction Agent.    (ix) In connection with any Discounted Term Loan Prepayment, the Borrower and the Lenders   acknowledge and agree that the Auction Agent may require as a condition to any Discounted Term Loan   Prepayment, the payment of customary fees and expenses from the Company Parties in connection therewith.    (m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.07 or any other provision of this   Agreement (including Section 2.05), so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or   would result therefrom, any of the Company Parties may make open market purchases of Term Loans (each, an   \u201cOpen Market Purchase\u201d), so long as the following conditions are satisfied:    (i) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to any such Open Market Purchase, the sum   of (x) the unused Revolving Credit Commitments and (y) the amount of unrestricted cash and Cash   Equivalents of the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be not less than $30,000,000;    (ii) any such Open Market Purchase shall be financed by the Company Parties with Internally Generated   Cash Flow or with Eligible Equity Proceeds or the proceeds of Permitted Subordinated Indebtedness, in each   case that are Not Otherwise Applied and shall in no event be funded with Borrowings hereunder;    (iii) the aggregate principal amount (calculated on the par amount thereof) of all Term Loans purchased   shall automatically be cancelled and retired on the settlement date of the relevant purchase (and may not be   resold);    (iv) at the time of each purchase of Term Loans through Open Market Purchases, the Borrower shall   pay, on the settlement date of each such purchase, all accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the purchased   Term Loans up to the settlement date of such       177      purchase (except to the extent otherwise set forth in the relevant purchase documents as agreed by the   respective selling Lender);    (v) such purchases shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of   Section 2.05 or 2.13; and    (vi) any such Open Market Purchase shall be effected through a recognized dealer in Term Loans and   the bid to purchase relating thereto shall remain outstanding for at least three (3) Business Days.    (n) The aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Term Loans of the applicable Class shall be deemed   reduced by the full par value of the aggregate principal amount of the Term Loans prepaid pursuant to   Section 10.07(l) or purchased pursuant to Section 10.07(m), and each principal repayment installment with respect   to the Term Loans of such Class pursuant to Section 2.07(a) shall be reduced pro rata by the aggregate principal   amount of Term Loans purchased.    (o) In the event that any Revolving Credit Lender shall become a Defaulting Lender or any of S&P, Moody\u2019s   or Thompson\u2019s BankWatch (or InsuranceWatch Ratings Service, in the case of Lenders that are insurance   companies (or Best\u2019s Insurance Reports, if such insurance company is not rated by Insurance Watch Ratings   Service)) shall, after the date that any Lender becomes a Revolving Credit Lender, downgrade the long term   certificate deposit ratings of such Lender, and the resulting ratings shall be below BBB-, Baa3 or C, as the case may   be, (or BB, in the case of a Lender that is an insurance company (or B, in the case of an insurance company not rated   by InsuranceWatch Ratings Service)) (or, with respect to any Revolving Credit Lender that is not rated by any such   ratings service or provider, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender shall have reasonably determined that there has   occurred a material adverse change in the financial condition of any such Lender, or a material impairment of the   ability of any such Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, as compared to such condition or ability as of the   date that any such Lender became a Revolving Credit Lender) then the L/C Issuer shall have the right, but not the   obligation, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, to replace such Lender   with an assignee (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.07(b) above), and such     Lender hereby agrees to transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions   contained in Section 10.07(b) above, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the prior written consent of the Borrower   to the extent otherwise required by Section 10.07(b)) (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed);   provided that if the Borrower does not respond to a request for a consent within 10 Business Days, the Borrower will   be deemed to have consented thereto) all its interests, rights and obligations in respect of its Revolving Credit   Commitment to such assignee; provided, however, that (i) no such assignment shall conflict with any law, rule and   regulation or order of any Governmental Authority and (ii) the L/C Issuer or such assignee, as the case may be, shall   pay to such Lender in immediately available funds on the date of such assignment the principal of and interest   accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by such Lender hereunder and all other amounts accrued for such   Lender\u2019s account or owed to it hereunder.    Section 10.08 Confidentiality. Each of the Agents and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the   Information, except that Information may be disclosed (a) to it and       178      its Affiliates\u2019 directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it   being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of   such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory   authority; (c) to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process   (provided that the Agent or Lender that discloses any Information pursuant to this clause (c) shall provide the   Borrower prompt notice of such disclosure to the extent permitted by applicable Law); (d) to any other party to this   Agreement; (e) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 10.08   (or as may otherwise be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower), to any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any   prospective Eligible Assignee or pledgee of or Participant in (other than, in each case, any Competitors), any of its   rights or obligations under this Agreement; (f) with the written consent of the Borrower; (g) to the extent such   Information becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 10.08; (h) to any state,   Federal or foreign authority or examiner (including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any   other similar organization) (in which case such Person shall, except with respect to any audit or examination   conducted by bank accountants or any governmental bank regulatory authority exercising examination or regulatory   authority, promptly notify the Borrower, in advance, to the extent lawfully permitted to do so); (i) to any rating   agency when required by it (it being understood that, prior to any such disclosure, such rating agency shall   undertake to preserve the confidentiality of any Information relating to the Loan Parties received by it from such   Lender); (j) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any   action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder   or thereunder to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with such enforcement or (k) to any direct or indirect   contractual counterparty in swap agreements or such contractual counterparty\u2019s professional advisor (so long as such   contractual counterparty or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty agrees to be bound by the   provisions of this Section 10.08). In addition, the Agents and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this   Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending   industry, and service providers to the Agents and the Lenders in connection with the administration and management   of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Commitments, and the Credit Extensions. For the purposes of this   Section 10.08, \u201cInformation\u201d means all information received from any Loan Party relating to any Loan Party or its   business, other than any such information that is publicly available (or is derived from such information) to any   Agent or any Lender prior to disclosure by any Loan Party other than as a result of a breach of this Section 10.08 or   was independently developed by any Loan Party; provided that, in the case of information received from a Loan   Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.    Section 10.09 Setoff. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the   occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, after obtaining the prior written consent of the   Administrative Agent, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the   Borrower or any other Loan Party, any such notice being waived by the Borrower (on its own behalf and on behalf   of each other Loan Party) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or   special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other Indebtedness at any time owing by, such   Lender to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing to   such Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not     such Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and   although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that of the       179      applicable deposit or Indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such   right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further   application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.17 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by   such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and   the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement   describing in reasonable detail the Secured Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised   such right of setoff. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any   such set off and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the   validity of such setoff and application. The rights of the Administrative Agent and each Lender under this   Section 10.09 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of setoff) that   the Administrative Agent and such Lender may have.    Section 10.10 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan   Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of   non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the \u201cMaximum Rate\u201d). If any Agent or any Lender shall receive   interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the   Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest   contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the   extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or   premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate,   allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the   Obligations hereunder.    Section 10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement and each other Loan Document may be executed in one or more   counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same   instrument. Delivery by telecopier of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement and each other   Loan Document shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement and such other   Loan Document. The Agents may also require that any such documents and signatures delivered by telecopier be   confirmed by a manually signed original thereof; provided that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not   limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier.    Section 10.12 Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, comprises the complete   and integrated agreement of the parties on the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements,   written or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and   those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of   supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agents or the Lenders in any other Loan Document shall not be   deemed to be a conflict with this Agreement. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the   respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance   with the fair meaning thereof.    Section 10.13 Survival of Representations and Warranties.    (a) All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document   delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery   hereof and thereof. Such representations and warranties       180      have been or will be relied upon by each Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by any Agent   or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that any Agent or any Lender may have had notice or   knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as   any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain     outstanding except as set forth in Section 2.03(g). The provisions of  3 and Sections 9.02, 9.03, 9.07, 9.11,   9.13, 10.04, 10.05, 10.09 and 10.15 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation   of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of   Credit or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else   to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that, in connection with the refinancing or repayment in full   of the credit facilities provided for herein, the L/C Issuer shall have provided to the Administrative Agent a written   consent to the release of the Revolving Lenders from their obligations hereunder with respect to any Letter of Credit   issued by such L/C Issuer (whether as a result of the obligations of the Borrower (and any other account party) in   respect of such Letter of Credit having been collateralized in full by a deposit of cash with the L/C Issuer or being   supported by a letter of credit that names such L/C Issuer as the beneficiary thereunder, or otherwise), then from and   after such time such Letter of Credit shall cease to be a \u201cLetter of Credit\u201d outstanding hereunder for all purposes of   this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be deemed to have no   participations in such Letter of Credit, and no obligations with respect thereto, under Section 2.03(c) or (d).    Section 10.14 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be   illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this   Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby. The invalidity of a provision in   a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without   limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.14, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions   in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith   by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be   deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.    Section 10.15 Tax Forms    (a) Each Lender (which, for purposes of this Section 10.15 shall include any L/C Issuer or any Swing Line   Lender) shall deliver to the Borrower and to the Administrative Agent, whenever reasonably requested by the   Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and duly executed documentation prescribed by   applicable Laws and such other reasonably requested information as will permit the Borrower or the Administrative   Agent, as the case may be, (A) to determine whether or not payments made hereunder or under any other Loan   Document are subject to Taxes, (B) to determine, if applicable, the required rate of withholding or deduction and   (C) to establish such Lender\u2019s entitlement to any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in   respect of any payments to be made to such Lender pursuant to any Loan Document or otherwise to establish such   Lender\u2019s status for withholding tax purposes in an applicable jurisdiction (including, if applicable, any   documentation necessary to prevent withholding under Sections 1471-1474 of the Code). Without limiting the   generality of the foregoing,       181      (i) to the extent it is qualified for any exemption from or reduction in United States federal withholding   tax with respect to any Loan made to the Borrower, each Lender and Agent that is not a \u201cUnited States   person\u201d within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code that lends to the Borrower (each, a \u201cNon-US   Lender\u201d) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, on or prior to the date which is ten   (10) Business Days after the Closing Date (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly   signed, properly completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8EXP or any successor thereto (relating to   such Non-US Lender and entitling it to an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding   tax on specified payments to be made to such Non-US Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or   any other Loan Document) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor thereto (relating to all payments to be made   to such Non-US Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document) and/or   such other forms and evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such   Non-US Lender is entitled to an exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding tax,   including, if applicable, any documentation necessary to prevent withholding under Sections 1471-1474 of the   Code and/or any exemption pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code, and in the case of a Non-US Lender   claiming such an exemption under Section 881(c) of the Code, a certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibits S-1, S-2, S-3 and S-4 (the \u201cUS Tax Certificate\u201d) that establishes in writing to the Borrower and the   Administrative Agent that such Non-US Lender is not (A) a \u201cbank\u201d within the meaning of   Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a 10-percent shareholder within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) or     881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, (C) a controlled foreign corporation described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code   and (D) receiving any payment under any Loan Document that is effectively connected with a US trade or   business. Thereafter and from time to time, to the extent it is then qualified for any exemption from or   reduction in United States federal withholding tax, each such Non-US Lender shall (A) promptly submit to the   Borrower and the Administrative Agent such additional duly and properly completed and signed copies of one   or more of such forms or certificates (or such successor forms or certificates as shall be adopted from time to   time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United   States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the   Administrative Agent of any available exemption from, or reduction of, United States federal withholding   taxes in respect of payments to be made to such Non-US Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement,   or any other Loan Document, in each case, (1) on or before the date that any such form, certificate or other   evidence expires or becomes obsolete, (2) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most   recent form, certificate or evidence previously delivered by it to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent   and (3) from time to time thereafter if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, and   (B) promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any change in circumstances which would   modify or render invalid any previously claimed exemption or reduction;    (ii) each Non-US Lender, to the extent it does not act or ceases to act for its own account with respect to   any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Non-US Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for   example, in the case of a typical participation       182      by such Non-US Lender, or where Non-US Lender is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes),   shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on the date when such Non-US Lender ceases to   act for its own account with respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at such other times   as may be necessary in the determination of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (in either case, in the   reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed, properly completed copies of the forms or   statements required to be provided by such Non-US Lender as set forth above, to establish the portion of any   such sums paid or payable with respect to which such Non-US Lender acts for its own account that is not   subject to United States federal withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed, properly completed copies of IRS   Form W-8IMY (or any successor thereto), together with any information such Non-US Lender is required to   transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Code, to   establish that such Non-US Lender is not acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums   payable to such Non-US Lender, including any applicable US Tax Certificate, provided that if the Lender is a   partnership and one or more of its partners are claiming the exemption for portfolio interest under   Section 881(c) of the Code, such Lender shall provide a US Tax Certificate on behalf of such partners; and    (iii) to the extent it is qualified for any exemption from or reduction in United States federal withholding   tax with respect to any Loan made to the Borrower, each Lender and Agent that lends to the Borrower, shall   timely deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as   a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding tax or otherwise   reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent together with such supplementary   documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Laws or otherwise reasonably requested by the Borrower   or the Administrative Agent to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding   or deduction required to be made.    (b) The applicable withholding agent may deduct and withhold any taxes required by any Laws to be deducted   and withheld from any payment under any of the Loan Documents.    (c) Each Lender and Agent that is a \u201cUnited States person\u201d within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the   Code that lends to the Borrower (each, a \u201cUS Lender\u201d) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower   two duly signed, properly completed copies of IRS Form W-9 on or prior to the Closing Date (or on or prior to the   date it becomes a party to this Agreement), certifying that such US Lender is entitled to an exemption from United   States backup withholding tax, or any successor form. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,   if such US Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the applicable withholding agent may withhold from any   payment to such US Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable backup withholding tax imposed by the Code   and the Borrower shall not be liable for any additional amounts with respect to such withholding.      (d) If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Borrower or the Administrative Agent did not properly   withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any Excluded Taxes from payments made to or for the account of   any Lender or Agent, then to the extent such improper withholding or backup withholding was directly caused by   such Lender\u2019s or Agent\u2019s actions       183      or inactions, such Lender shall indemnify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent for any Excluded Taxes   imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent under this   Section 10.15, and costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.   The obligation of the Lenders, severally, under this Section 10.15 shall survive any assignment of rights by, or the   replacement of, a Lender or the termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations   hereunder and the resignation of the Administrative Agent.    (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.15, no Lender or Agent shall be required to   deliver any documentation that it is not legally eligible to deliver.    (f) Prior to the Closing Date, the Administrative Agent will provide the Borrower with a properly executed   and completed IRS Form W-8IMY, with boxes 11 and 12 checked, confirming that the Administrative Agent is a   \u201cU.S. branch\u201d that will be responsible for administering U.S. FDAP withholding.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT    Dunkin\u2019 Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation (the \u201cInitial Borrower\u201d) is party to the Credit   Agreement dated as of November 23, 2010 (as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise   modified from time to time, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with certain Lenders party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as   Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer and, upon the Assumption (as defined below), Dunkin\u2019   Brands, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the \u201cBorrower\u201d) and, upon the effectiveness of its joinder to the Credit   Agreement, Holdings. The rights and obligations of the Initial Borrower under Credit Agreement will be assumed by   the Borrower on the date hereof and the Borrower will merge into the Initial Borrower with the Borrower being the   surviving entity (the \u201cAssumption\u201d). Each Guarantor will derive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the   transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and the Secured Hedge Agreements (together with all   instruments, agreements or other documents evidencing the Cash Management Obligations, the \u201cFinance     Documents\u201d) and it is in the interest of each such Guarantor to make this Guaranty in favor of the Secured Parties. It   is a covenant under the Credit Agreement that each Guarantor (other than a Guarantor in its capacity as an   Additional Guarantor following the execution of a Guaranty Supplement) shall have executed and delivered this   Guaranty.    The potential obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty are not disproportionate to the benefits   derived by such Guarantor from the making of extensions of credit to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and   the other financing arrangements described above and/or to each such Guarantor\u2019s net worth.    The execution, delivery and performance by each Guarantor of this Guaranty has been duly authorized   by all necessary corporate or limited liability company action on the part of such Guarantor.    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the Loans and Letters of Credit heretofore or   hereafter from time to time made or issued by the Lenders under the Credit Agreement, each Guarantor, jointly and   severally with each other Guarantor, hereby agrees as follows:    Section 1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Guaranty and not defined herein shall have the   meanings set forth in the Credit Agreement.    (a) The rules of construction specified in Section 1.02 of the Credit Agreement also apply to this   Guaranty.      (b) As used in this Guaranty, the following terms have the meanings specified below:    \u201cAssumption\u201d has the meaning specified in the preliminary statement to this Guaranty.    \u201cBorrower\u201d has the meaning specified in the preliminary statement to this Guaranty.    \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d has the meaning specified in the preliminary statement to this Guaranty.    \u201cFinance Documents\u201d has the meaning specified in the preliminary statement to this Guaranty.    \u201cGuarantor\u201d means Holdings, each of the other Persons listed on Schedule I hereto or the Additional   Guarantors, as the context may require, and \u201cGuarantors\u201d means, collectively, Holdings, each of the other Persons   listed on Schedule I hereto and the Additional Guarantors.    \u201cGuaranty\u201d has the meaning specified in the preamble to this Guaranty.    \u201cGuaranty Supplement\u201d means a guaranty supplement in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.    \u201cHoldings\u201d has the meaning specified in the preamble to this Guaranty.    Section 2. Guaranty; Limitation of Liability.    (a) Each Guarantor hereby, jointly and severally with the other Guarantors, absolutely, unconditionally   and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment, whether at scheduled maturity or by acceleration, demand or   otherwise, of all Obligations of the Borrower, each Loan Party guaranteeing the Obligations of the Borrower and   any Restricted Subsidiary which is an obligor with respect to any Secured Hedge Agreements now or hereafter   existing or any Cash Management Obligations now or hereafter existing (including, without limitation, any   extensions, modifications, substitutions, amendments or renewals of any or all of the foregoing Obligations),   whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities,   contract causes of action, costs, expenses or otherwise (such Obligations, the \u201cGuaranteed Obligations\u201d), and   agrees to pay any and all reasonable expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in   enforcing any rights under this Guaranty or any other Loan Document in accordance with Section 10.04 of the   Credit Agreement (including reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of any law firm or other external counsel   to the Administrative Agent). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor\u2019s liability shall   extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by any other Guarantor   to any Secured Party under or in respect of the Finance Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not     allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, liquidation, receivership, examiner-ship, administration,   reorganization or similar proceeding involving such other Guarantor.       2      (b) Each Subsidiary Guarantor, and by acceptance of this Guaranty, the Administrative Agent and each   other Secured Party, hereby confirm that it is the intention of all such Persons that this Guaranty and the Obligations   of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of Debtor   Relief Laws (as hereinafter defined), the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act   or any similar or analogous foreign, federal or state Law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the   Obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Administrative   Agent, the other Secured Parties and the Subsidiary Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of each   such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in   the Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or   conveyance. For purposes hereof, \u201cDebtor Relief Laws\u201d means any proceeding of the type referred to in   Section 8.01(f) of the Credit Agreement or any Debtor Relief Law (as defined in the Credit Agreement).    (c) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that in the event any payment shall be   required to be made to any Secured Party under this Guaranty, or any other guaranty, such Guarantor will contribute,   to the maximum extent permitted by Law, such amounts to each other Guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate   amount paid to the Secured Parties under or in respect of the Finance Documents.    (d) To the extent that any Guarantor shall be required hereunder to pay a portion of the Guaranteed   Obligations exceeding the greater of (a) the amount of the economic benefit actually received by such Guarantor   from the Loans and (b) the amount such Guarantor would otherwise have paid if such Guarantor had paid the   aggregate amount of the Guaranteed Obligations (excluding the amount thereof repaid by the Borrower) in the same   proportion as such Guarantor\u2019s net worth at the date enforcement is sought hereunder bears to the aggregate net   worth of such Guarantor and all of the other Guarantors (the \u201cOther Guarantors\u201d) at the date of enforcement is   sought hereunder, then each Other Guarantor shall reimburse such Guarantor for the amount of such excess, pro   rata, based on the respective net worths of such Other Guarantors at the date enforcement hereunder is sought.    Section 3. Guaranty Absolute. Each Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid   strictly in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents, regardless of any Law, regulation or order now or   hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of any Secured Party with respect   thereto. The Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due and   not of collection, that the Obligations of each Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are those of primary   obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any other Obligations of   any other Guarantor under or in respect of the Finance Documents, and that a separate action or actions may be   brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is   brought against the Borrower or any other Guarantor or whether the Borrower or any other Guarantor is joined in   any such action or actions. The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and   unconditional irrespective of, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by   applicable Law, any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the   following:    (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Finance Document or any agreement or instrument   relating thereto;       3      (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the   Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations of any other Guarantor under or in respect of the Finance   Documents, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Finance Document,   including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of additional   credit to the Borrower, any Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries or otherwise;      (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral or any other collateral, or any   taking, release or amendment or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, for all or any of the   Guaranteed Obligations;    (d) any manner of application of Collateral or any other collateral, or proceeds thereof, to all or any of   the Guaranteed Obligations, or any manner of sale or other disposition of any Collateral or any other collateral for   all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations of any Guarantor under the Finance Documents or   any other assets of the Borrower, any Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries;    (e) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of the Borrower, any   Guarantor or any of their respective Subsidiaries;    (f) any failure of any Secured Party to disclose to any Guarantor any information relating to the   business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of the Borrower or any   other Guarantor now or hereafter known to such Secured Party (each Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the   Secured Parties to disclose such information);    (g) the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver this Guaranty, any Guaranty Supplement (as   hereinafter defined) or any other guaranty or agreement or the release or reduction of liability of any Guarantor or   other guarantor or surety with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; or    (h) any other circumstance or any existence of or reliance on any representation by any Secured Party   that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Guarantor or any other guarantor or   surety.    This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any   of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Secured Party or any other Person   upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, receivership, examinership, administration or reorganization of the   Borrower or any Guarantor or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.    Section 4. Waivers and Acknowledgments.    (a) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of   acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or   dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any   requirement that any Secured Party protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or   exhaust any right or take any action against any Guarantor or any other Person or any Collateral.       4      (b) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty   and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether   existing now or in the future.

(d) Each Guarantor (x) acknowledges that the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties   may, in accordance with the Loan Documents, without notice to or demand upon such Guarantor and without   affecting the liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty, (i) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge,   accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof,   (ii) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the   payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations, (iii) apply such security and direct the order or manner of   sale thereof as the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion may determine and (iv) release or substitute one or     more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and (y) hereby waives any defense   to the recovery by the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties against such Guarantor of any deficiency   after any such action and any defense or benefits that may be afforded by applicable Law.

Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise   any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any of their   respective Subsidiaries that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor\u2019s   Obligations under or in respect of this Guaranty or any other Finance Document, including, without limitation, any   right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to participate in any   claim or remedy of any Secured Party against the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any of their respective   Subsidiaries or any Collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute   or common Law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Borrower, any other Guarantor   or any of their respective Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other   manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until (a) all of the Guaranteed   Obligations (other than (x) (i) Cash Management Obligations and (ii) Obligations under Secured       5      Hedge Agreements not yet due and payable, and (y) contingent obligations not yet accrued and payable) shall have   been paid in full, (b) all Letters of Credit shall have been Cash Collateralized or otherwise back-stopped (including   by \u201cgrandfathering\u201d into any future credit facilities), in each case, on terms reasonably satisfactory to the relevant   L/C Issuer in its reasonable discretion, or shall have expired or been terminated, and (c) the Aggregate   Commitments shall have expired or been terminated (clauses (a) through (c), collectively, \u201cFull Satisfaction of the   Obligations\u201d).

Upon Full Satisfaction of the Obligations, the Secured Parties will, at such Guarantor\u2019s request and expense,   execute and deliver to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or   warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed   Obligations resulting from such payment made by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.

A Guarantor shall automatically be   released from this Guaranty and its obligations hereunder upon consummation of any Disposition or other   transaction or designation permitted by the Credit Agreement as a result of which such Guarantor ceases to be a   Restricted Subsidiary; provided that no such release shall occur if such Guarantor is a guarantor in respect of any   Specified Junior Financing Obligations, The Administrative Agent will, at such Guarantor\u2019s expense, execute and   deliver to such Guarantor such documents as such Guarantor shall reasonably request to evidence the release of such   Guarantor from its Guarantee hereunder pursuant to this Section 8; provided that such Guarantor shall have   delivered to the Administrative Agent a written request therefor and a certificate of such Guarantor to the effect that   the transaction is in compliance with the Loan Documents. The       6      Administrative Agent shall be authorized to rely on any such certificate without independent investigation.    Section 9. Guaranty Supplements.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,   the Administrative Agent and, after obtaining the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, each other   Agent and each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by   Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time   held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Agent or such Lender to or for the credit or the account of   any Guarantor against any and all of the Obligations of such Guarantor now or hereafter existing under the Loan   Documents, irrespective of whether such Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand under this Guaranty or   any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be unmatured. Each Agent and each Lender agrees   promptly to notify such Guarantor after any such set-off and application; provided that the failure to give such notice   shall not affect the validity       7         of such set-off and application.

(b) While any Event of Default set forth in Section 8.01(a) exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on all   overdue amounts hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the   fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on   past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.    (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto   and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with   the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any   Debtor Relief Law.    Section 2.09 Fees. In addition to certain fees described in Section 2.03(i) and Section 2.03(j):    (a) Revolving Credit Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of   each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a commitment fee (each, a \u201cRevolving Credit   Commitment Fee\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cRevolving Credit Commitment Fees\u201d) equal to the Applicable Rate   times the actual daily amount by which the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the   Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations. The   Revolving Credit Commitment Fees shall accrue at all times from the date hereof until the Maturity Date of the   Revolving Credit Facility, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in  4 is not met,   and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and   December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date for the   Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Commitment Fees shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if   there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and   multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in   effect.    (b) Other Fees. The Borrower shall pay or cause to be paid to the Agents such fees as shall have been   separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when   paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.    (c) Funding Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay on the Closing Date (x) to each Term B Lender party to this   Agreement on the Closing Date, as fee compensation for the funding of       81      such Lender\u2019s Term B Loan, a funding fee (the \u201cTerm B Closing Date Funding Fee\u201d) in an amount equal to 0.50%   of the stated principal amount of such Lender\u2019s Term B Loans funded on the Closing Date; provided that if the   Special Mandatory Prepayment Date occurs, the Term Loans will be prepaid at the principal amount thereof minus   the Term B Closing Date Funding Fee plus accrued interest, in accordance with Section 2.05(b)(viii) and (y) to each   Revolving Credit Lender party to this Agreement on the Escrow Release Date, as fee compensation for the funding   of such Lender\u2019s Revolving Credit Commitment, a funding fee (the \u201cRevolving Credit Commitment Closing Date   Funding Fee\u201d and together with the Term B Closing Date Funding Fee, the \u201cClosing Date Funding Fees\u201d) in an     amount equal to 0.50% of the stated principal amount of such Lender\u2019s Revolving Credit Commitment on the   Escrow Release Date.    Section 2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when the   Base Rate is determined by the Administrative Agent\u2019s \u201cprime rate\u201d shall be made on the basis of a year of three   hundred and sixty-five (365) or three hundred and sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.   All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a three hundred and sixty (360) day year   and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the   basis of a three hundred and sixty-five (365) day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the   Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion   is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a),   bear interest for one (1) day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder   shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.    Section 2.11 Evidence of Indebtedness.    (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records   maintained by such Lender and evidenced by one or more entries in the Register maintained by the Administrative   Agent in accordance with Section 10.07(c), acting as a non-fiduciary agent solely for purposes of Treasury   Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c), as agent for the Borrower, in each case in the ordinary course of business. The   accounts or records maintained by each Lender and the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent shall be   prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the   Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however,   limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the   Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the   Register in respect of such matters, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of   any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through   the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lender\u2019s Loans in addition to   such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if   applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. The Borrower and each Lender   agrees from time to time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under   Section 8.01(f) or Section 8.01(g)(i) to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent all such Notes or other   promissory notes and other instruments and documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request to   evidence and confirm the respective interests and obligations of the Lenders after giving effect       82      to any exchange of Lenders\u2019 interests pursuant to arrangements relating thereto among the Lenders, and each Lender   agrees to surrender any Notes or other promissory notes originally received by it in connection with its Loans   hereunder to the Administrative Agent against delivery of any Notes or other promissory notes so executed and   delivered.    (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.11(a), each Lender and the Administrative   Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records and, in the case of the Administrative   Agent, entries in the Register, evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of   Credit and Swing Line Loans. In the event of any conflict between the Register and the accounts and records of any   Lender in respect of such matters, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error.    (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and   Section 2.11(b), and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.11(b), shall   be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from   the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender,   under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of the   Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or   such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement   and the other Loan Documents.      Section 2.12 Payments Generally.    (a) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, all payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made   without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly   provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account   of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent\u2019s Office in Dollars and in   immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will   promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment   in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender\u2019s Lending Office. All payments received by the   Administrative Agent after 4:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day in the   Administrative Agent\u2019s sole discretion and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue to the extent   applicable.    (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment   shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing   interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal   of Eurodollar Rate Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the   immediately preceding Business Day.    (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is   required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may   be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the   case may be, has timely made such       83      payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the   Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in   immediately available funds, then:    (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the   Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in   immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date   such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is   repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the applicable Federal Funds Rate from   time to time in effect; and    (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the   Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the   period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date   such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the \u201cCompensation Period\u201d) at a rate per annum   equal to the applicable Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. When such Lender makes payment to   the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding   the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall   constitute such Lender\u2019s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount   forthwith upon the Administrative Agent\u2019s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand   therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together   with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to   the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill   its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against   any Lender as a result of any Default by such Lender hereunder.    A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this   Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.    (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender   as provided in the foregoing provisions of this  2, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by   the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in  4 are not     satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds   (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.    (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and   Swing Line Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such   participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do   so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or   purchase its participation.       84      (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular   place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any   Loan in any particular place or manner.    (g) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other   Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the   Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be   distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of   priority set forth in Section 8.03. If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the   Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not   specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated   to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender\u2019s Pro Rata Share of the sum   of (i) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of all L/C   Obligations outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other   Obligations then owing to such Lender.    Section 2.13 Sharing of Payments. If, (other than (x) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for   the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or Participant, including any assignee   or participant that is a Sponsor, a Loan Party or an Affiliate of any Loan Party or Sponsor or (y) as otherwise   expressly provided elsewhere herein, including, without limitation, as provided in Section 10.07(l)) any Lender shall   obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by   it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess   of its ratable share (or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately (a) notify the   Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made   by them and/or such subparticipations in the participations in L/C Obligations or Swing Line Loans held by them, as   the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment in respect of   such Loans or such participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided that if all or any portion   of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances   described in Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the purchasing Lender in its   discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Lender shall repay to the purchasing   Lender the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying Lender\u2019s ratable share   (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Lender\u2019s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so   recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in   respect of the total amount so recovered, without further interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so   purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, exercise all its rights of   payment (including the right of setoff, but subject to Section 10.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if   such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent   will keep records and maintain entries in the Register (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of   manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section 2.13 and will in each case notify the Lenders   following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that       85      purchases participation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all   notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of     the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the   Obligations purchased.    Section 2.14 Incremental Facilities.    (a) At any time or from time to time after the Closing Date, the Borrower may by written notice to the   Administrative Agent elect to request (A) prior to the Maturity Date of the Revolving Credit Facility, (I) one or   more increases to the existing Revolving Credit Commitments and/or (II) the establishment of one or more new   revolving credit commitments (any such increase or new commitment, the \u201cNew Revolving Credit   Commitments\u201d) and/or (B) prior to the Maturity Date of the Term B Loan Facility, the establishment of one or   more new term loan commitments (the \u201cNew Term Commitments\u201d). Each New Revolving Credit Commitment   and New Term Commitment shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not less than $5,000,000 individually   (or such lesser amount which shall be approved by Administrative Agent or such lesser amount if such amount   represents all remaining availability under the limit set forth in the next sentence), and integral multiples of   $1,000,000 in excess of that amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the aggregate amount of   the New Revolving Credit Commitments shall not exceed $150,000,000 and (ii) subject to the preceding clause (i),   the aggregate amount of the New Revolving Credit Commitments and New Term Commitments shall not exceed   $350,000,000 plus an additional amount of New Revolving Credit Commitments and New Term Commitments so   long as (x) in the case of New Revolving Credit Commitments and New Term Commitments that are secured   equally and ratably with the Facilities, the First Lien Senior Secured Leverage Ratio shall be no greater than 3.75 to   1.0 as of the end of the Test Period most recently ended after giving Pro Forma Effect to such New Revolving Credit   Commitments or New Term Loans and (y) in the case of New Revolving Credit Commitments and New Term   Commitments that are secured by a lien that is junior to the liens securing the Facilities, the Senior Secured   Leverage Ratio shall be no greater than 4.0 to 1.0 as of the end of the Test Period most recently ended after giving   Pro Forma Effect to such New Revolving Credit Commitments or New Term Loans (and, in each case, with respect   to any New Revolving Credit Commitment, assuming a borrowing of the maximum amount of Loans available   under such New Revolving Credit Commitment and any New Revolving Credit Commitments previously made   pursuant to this Section 2.14). Each such notice shall specify (A) the date (each, an \u201cIncreased Amount Date\u201d) on   which the Borrower proposes that the New Revolving Credit Commitments or New Term Commitments, as   applicable, shall be effective, which shall be a date not less than 5 Business Days after the date on which such notice   is delivered to the Administrative Agent, (or such shorter period as shall be reasonably acceptable to the   Administrative Agent and (B) the identity of each Lender or other Person that is an Eligible Assignee (each, a \u201cNew   Revolving Credit Lender\u201d or \u201cNew Term Lender,\u201d as applicable) to whom the Borrower proposes any portion of   such New Revolving Credit Commitments or New Term Commitments, as applicable, be allocated and the amounts   of such allocations; provided that (x) any Lender approached to provide all or a portion of the New Revolving Credit   Commitments or New Term Commitments may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide a New Revolving   Credit Commitment or a New Term Commitment (it being understood that there is no obligation to approach any   existing Lenders to provide any New Revolving Credit Commitment or New Term       86      Commitment) and (y) the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line Lender shall have consented   (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) to such Person\u2019s providing such New Revolving Credit   Commitments or New Term Commitments if such consent would be required under Section 10.07 for an assignment   of Loans or Commitments to such Person. Such New Revolving Credit Commitments or New Term Commitments   shall become effective, as of such Increased Amount Date; provided that (1) no Default or Event of Default shall   exist on such Increased Amount Date after giving effect to such New Revolving Credit Commitments or New Term   Commitments, as applicable; (2) after giving effect to the making of any New Term Loans or effectiveness of New   Revolving Credit Commitments, each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 shall be satisfied; (3) (i) the   Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be in Pro Forma Compliance with each of the covenants set forth in   Section 7.10 after giving Pro Forma Effect to such New Revolving Credit Commitments or New Term Loans (and   with respect to any New Revolving Credit Commitment, assuming a borrowing of the maximum amount of Loans   available under such New Revolving Credit Commitment and any New Revolving Credit Commitments previously   made pursuant to this Section 2.14), as applicable; (4) the New Revolving Credit Commitments or New Term   Commitments, as applicable, shall be effected pursuant to one or more Joinder Agreements executed and delivered   by the Borrower, the New Revolving Credit Lender or New Term Lender, as applicable, and Administrative Agent,     and each of which shall be recorded in the Register, and each New Revolving Credit Lender and New Term Lender   shall be subject to the requirements set forth in Section 10.15; (5) the Borrower shall make any payments required   pursuant to Section 3.05 in connection with the New Revolving Credit Commitments or New Term Commitments, if   applicable; and (6) the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered any customary legal opinions or other   documents reasonably requested by Administrative Agent in connection with any such transaction.    (b) On any Increased Amount Date on which New Revolving Credit Commitments are effected through an   increase to the existing Revolving Credit Commitments, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and   conditions, (a) each of the Revolving Credit Lenders shall assign to each of the New Revolving Credit Lenders, and   each of the New Revolving Credit Lenders shall purchase from each of the Revolving Credit Lenders, at the   principal amount thereof, such interests in the Revolving Credit Loans outstanding on such Increased Amount Date   as shall be necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, such Revolving Credit   Loans will be held by existing Revolving Credit Lenders and New Revolving Credit Lenders ratably in accordance   with their Revolving Credit Commitments after giving effect to the addition of such New Revolving Credit   Commitments to the Revolving Credit Commitments, (b) each New Revolving Credit Commitment shall be deemed   for all purposes a Revolving Credit Commitment and each Loan made thereunder shall be deemed, for all purposes,   a Revolving Credit Loan and (c) each New Revolving Credit Lender shall become a Lender with respect to the New   Revolving Credit Commitment and all matters relating thereto. Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree   that the minimum borrowing and prepayment requirements in Section 2.02 and 2.05(a) of this Agreement shall not   apply to the transactions effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.    (c) Any New Term Loans or New Revolving Credit Loans effected through the establishment of one or more   new revolving credit commitments or new Term Loans made on an Increased Amount Date shall be designated a   separate Class of New Term Loans or New Revolving       87      Credit Loans, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement. On any Increased Amount Date on which any New   Term Commitments of any Class are effected, subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions,   (i) each New Term Lender of such Class shall make a Loan to the Borrower (a \u201cNew Term Loan\u201d) in an amount   equal to its New Term Commitment of such Class, and (ii) each New Term Lender of such Class shall become a   Lender hereunder with respect to the New Term Commitment of such Class and the New Term Loans of such Class   made pursuant thereto. On any Increased Amount Date on which any New Revolving Credit Commitments of any   Class are effected through the establishment of one or more new revolving credit commitments, subject to the   satisfaction of the foregoing terms and conditions, (i) each New Revolving Credit Lender of such Class shall make   its Commitment available to the Borrower (when borrowed, a \u201cNew Revolving Credit Loan\u201d) in an amount equal   to its New Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class, and (ii) each New Revolving Credit Lender of such Class   shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to the New Revolving Credit Commitment of such Class and the New   Revolving Credit Loans of such Class made pursuant thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, New Term Loans may   have identical terms to the Term Loans and be treated as the same Class as the Term B Loans.

(a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records   maintained by such Lender and evidenced by one or more entries in the Register maintained by the Administrative   Agent in accordance with Section 10.07(c), acting as a non-fiduciary agent solely for purposes of Treasury   Regulation Section 5f.103-1(c), as agent for the Borrower, in each case in the ordinary course of business. The   accounts or records maintained by each Lender and the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent shall be   prima facie evidence absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the   Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however,   limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the   Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the   Register in respect of such matters, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of   any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through   the Administrative Agent) a Note payable to such Lender, which shall evidence such Lender\u2019s Loans in addition to   such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if   applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

In the event of any conflict between the Register and the accounts and records of any   Lender in respect of such matters, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error.    (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and   Section 2.11(b), and by each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Section 2.11(a) and Section 2.11(b), shall   be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from   the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender,   under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of the   Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or   such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement   and the other Loan Documents.      Section 2.12 Payments Generally.    (a) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, all payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made   without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly   provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account   of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent\u2019s Office in Dollars and in   immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will   promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment   in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender\u2019s Lending Office. All payments received by the   Administrative Agent after 4:00 p.m. shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day in the   Administrative Agent\u2019s sole discretion and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue to the extent   applicable.    (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment   shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing   interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal   of Eurodollar Rate Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the   immediately preceding Business Day.    (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is   required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may   be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the   case may be, has timely made such       83      payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the   Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in   immediately available funds, then:    (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the   Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in   immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date   such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is   repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the applicable Federal Funds Rate from   time to time in effect; and    (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on demand pay to the   Administrative Agent the amount thereof in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the   period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the date   such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the \u201cCompensation Period\u201d) at a rate per annum   equal to the applicable Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. When such Lender makes payment to   the Administrative Agent (together with all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding   the amount of any interest which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall   constitute such Lender\u2019s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount   forthwith upon the Administrative Agent\u2019s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand   therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together   with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to   the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill   its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have against   any Lender as a result of any Default by such Lender hereunder.    A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this   Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.    (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender   as provided in the foregoing provisions of this  2, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by   the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in  4 are not     satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds   (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.    (e) The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to fund participations in Letters of Credit and   Swing Line Loans are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to fund any such   participation on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do   so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or   purchase its participation.       84      (f) Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular   place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any   Loan in any particular place or manner.    (g) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any of the other   Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all amounts due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the   Lenders under or in respect of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be   distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the order of   priority set forth in Section 8.03. If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to the Obligations of the   Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not   specify the manner in which such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated   to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with such Lender\u2019s Pro Rata Share of the sum   of (i) the Outstanding Amount of all Loans outstanding at such time and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of all L/C   Obligations outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Loans or other   Obligations then owing to such Lender.

Revolving Credit Loans may   be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein; provided that all Revolving Credit Loans   made by each of the Lenders pursuant to the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically provided herein,   consist entirely of Revolving Credit Loans of the same Type.    Section 2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans.    (a) Each Term Borrowing, each Revolving Credit Borrowing, each conversion of Term Loans or Revolving   Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of       60        Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the Borrower\u2019s irrevocable delivery to the Administrative Agent of a   written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower.   Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent (i) not later than 11:00 a.m. three (3) Business Days   prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans, continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or   any conversion of Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) not later than 11:00 a.m. on the requested date of   any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans   shall be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Except as   provided in Section 2.03(c)(i) and Section 2.04(c)(i), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be   in a principal amount of $250,000 or a whole multiple of $50,000 in excess thereof (except, with respect to any   Other Term Loans, to the extent otherwise provided in the applicable Refinancing Amendment). Each Committed   Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Term Borrowing,   a Revolving Credit Borrowing, a conversion of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other,   or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as   the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or   continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans are to   be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto and (vi) the account of the   Borrower to be credited with the proceeds of such Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a   Committed Loan Notice or fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable   Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic   conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to   the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of   Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed   to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month.    (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each   Appropriate Lender of the amount of its Pro Rata Share of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a   conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the   details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or continuation described in Section 2.02(a). In the case of   each Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent   in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent\u2019s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. (with respect to   Eurodollar Rate Loans) or 2:00 p.m. (with respect to Base Rate Loans) on the Business Day specified in the   applicable Committed Loan Notice.

(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the   last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan unless the Borrower pays the amount due, if any, under   Section 3.05 in connection therewith. During the       61      existence of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may require that no Loans may   be converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans.    (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Appropriate Lenders of the interest   rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The   determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest   error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the   Appropriate Lenders of any change in the Administrative Agent\u2019s prime rate used in determining the Base Rate   promptly following the determination of such change.    (e) After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all Revolving Credit Borrowings, all conversions of Term   Loans or Revolving Credit Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans or Revolving   Credit Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than twenty (20) Interest Periods in effect.      (f) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any   other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall   be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on the date of   any Borrowing.

Within the   foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower\u2019s ability to obtain Letters of Credit   shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to   replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. On and after the Escrow   Release Date, each Existing Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a Letter of Credit       62      issued hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and for all purposes hereof will   be deemed to have been issued on the Escrow Release Date.    (ii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if    (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport   to enjoin or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer   or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with   jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of   letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with   respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not   otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any   unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which, in each case, the   L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;    (B) subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit, prior to giving   effect to any automatic renewal, would occur more than twelve months after the date of issuance or last   renewal, unless the Required Lenders and the L/C Issuer have approved such expiry date;    (C) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration   Date, unless all the Revolving Credit Lenders and the L/C Issuer have approved such expiry date and no   Revolving Credit Lender shall be required to participate in any such Letter of Credit issued without such   approval;    (D) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate any Laws or one or more policies of the L/C   Issuer; or    (E) any Revolving Credit Lender is a Defaulting Lender, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into   arrangements reasonably satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the L/C Issuer\u2019s risk with respect to   the participation in Letters of Credit by all such Defaulting Lenders, including by Cash Collateralizing, or     obtaining a backstop letter of credit from an issuer reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer to support, each   such Defaulting Lender\u2019s Pro Rata Share of any Unreimbursed Amount.    (iii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would   have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the   beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.    (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit.    (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower   delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in       63      the form of a L/C Request and Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible   Officer of the Borrower. Such L/C Request and Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and   the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon at least three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed issuance   date or date of amendment, as the case may be, or such later date and time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a   particular instance in its sole discretion. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such   Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the   proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof;   (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented   by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such   beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably request.   In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall   specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the   proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed amendment;   and (D) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably request.    (ii) Promptly after receipt of any L/C Request and Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm   with the Administrative Agent (in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such L/C Request   and Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent   with a copy thereof. Upon receipt by the L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative Agent that the   requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the terms hereof (such confirmation to be   promptly provided by the Administrative Agent), then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer   shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable   amendment, as the case may be. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit   Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer an   unfunded risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender\u2019s Pro Rata   Share times the amount of such Letter of Credit.    (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole   and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an \u201cAuto-  Renewal Letter of Credit\u201d); provided that any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must permit the L/C Issuer to   prevent any such renewal at least once in each twelve month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such   Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the \u201cNonrenewal Notice   Date\u201d) in each such twelve month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless   otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer   for any such renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have   authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an   expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such   renewal if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of   Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions       64         of Section 2.03(a)(ii) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which shall be in writing) on or before the day that   is five (5) Business Days before the Nonrenewal Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent that the Required   Lenders have elected not to permit such renewal or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Credit Lender   or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied.    (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising   bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Borrower and the   Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.    (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.    (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of   Credit, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 3:30 p.m. on   the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an \u201cHonor Date\u201d), the Borrower   shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing;   provided that if such notice is not provided to the Borrower prior to 1:00 p.m. on the Honor Date, then the Borrower   shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing   on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing fees in respect of   any such Letter of Credit. If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the Administrative   Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed   drawing (the \u201cUnreimbursed Amount\u201d), and the amount of such Revolving Credit Lender\u2019s Pro Rata Share   thereof. In such event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Borrowing of Base Rate   Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the   minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02(a) for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans but subject to the   amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02   (other than the delivery of a Committed Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative   Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may shall be in writing.    (ii) Each Revolving Credit Lender (including the Lender acting as L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant   to Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer, in Dollars,   at the Administrative Agent\u2019s Office in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later   than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the   provisions of Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to   have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so   received to the L/C Issuer.    (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit Borrowing   of Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the   Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the   Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand   (together with interest) and       65      shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each Revolving Credit Lender\u2019s payment to the Administrative   Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its   participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its   participation obligation under this Section 2.03.    (iv) Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Revolving Credit Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this   Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of   such Lender\u2019s Pro Rata Share of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.    (v) Each Revolving Credit Lender\u2019s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or L/C Advances to   reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall   be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim,   recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other     Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence,   event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Credit Lender\u2019s   obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in   Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C   Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount   of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.    (vi) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the   L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such   Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period   from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer   at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the L/C   Issuer submitted to any Revolving Credit Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts   owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.    (d) Repayment of Participations.    (i) If, at any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from   any Revolving Credit Lender such Lender\u2019s L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance with   Section 2.03(c), the Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the   related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including   proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute   to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the   period of time during which such Lender\u2019s L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by   the Administrative Agent.       66      (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to   Section 2.03(d)(i) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.06 (including   pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay   to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the   Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by   such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.    (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under   each Letter of Credit issued for its account and to repay each L/C Borrowing relating to any Letter of Credit issued   for its account shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the   terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:    (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement   or instrument relating thereto;    (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or   applicable Restricted Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter   of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer   or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by   such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;    (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be   forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in   any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a   drawing under such Letter of Credit;    (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or   certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the   L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-  possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to     any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any   proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;    (v) any exchange, release or nonperfection of any Collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of   or consent to departure from the Guaranty or any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of the   Borrower in respect of such Letter of Credit; or    (vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing,   including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the   Borrower;       67      provided that the foregoing shall not excuse the L/C Issuer from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct   damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are waived by the Borrower to the extent   permitted by applicable Law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the L/C Issuer\u2019s gross negligence, bad   faith or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit   comply with the terms thereof. The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit issued for its   account and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the   Borrower\u2019s instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will promptly notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall   be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such   notice is given as aforesaid.    (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of   Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft,   certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or   accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of   the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the   L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or   with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the   absence of gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a   final, non-appealable judgment; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document   or instrument related to any Letter of Credit, L/C Request or Letter of Credit Application. The Borrower hereby   assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of   Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower\u2019s pursuing such rights   and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at Law or under any other agreement. None of the   L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C   Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vi) of Section 2.03(e);   provided that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the   L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as   opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower that a court of competent jurisdiction   determines in a final, non-appealable judgment were caused by the L/C Issuer\u2019s willful misconduct, bad faith or   gross negligence or the L/C Issuer\u2019s willful or grossly negligent failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the   presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and   conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept   documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any   notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of   any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits   thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.    (g) Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, (i) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full   or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing       68      has resulted in an L/C Borrowing and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 to a Revolving Credit Borrowing   cannot then be met, or (ii) if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any Letter of Credit may for any reason   remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall promptly Cash Collateralize (x) in the case     of clause (i), 100% and (y) in the case of clause (ii), 105%, in each case of the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C   Obligations (such Outstanding Amount to be determined as of the date of such L/C Borrowing or the Letter of   Credit Expiration Date, as the case may be) or, in the case of clause (ii), provide a back to back letter of credit in a   face amount at least equal to 105% of the then undrawn amount of such Letter of Credit from an issuer and in form   and substance satisfactory to the L/C Issuer in its sole discretion. Any Letter of Credit that is so Cash Collateralized   or in respect of which such a back-to-back letter of credit shall have been issued shall be deemed no longer   outstanding for purposes of this Agreement. For purposes hereof, \u201cCash Collateralize\u201d means (A) in the case of   clause (ii) above, pledge and deposit with or deliver to the L/C Issuer, as collateral for the L/C Obligations and   (B) in all other cases to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C   Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances (\u201cCash Collateral\u201d)   pursuant to documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer and, in the case of clause   of (B), the Administrative Agent (which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders). Derivatives of such   term have corresponding meanings. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in deposit accounts designated by the   Administrative Agent and which is under the sole dominion and control of the L/C Issuer and, in the case of clause   of (B), the Administrative Agent. If at any time the L/C Issuer and, in the case of clause of (B), the Administrative   Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than   the L/C Issuer or Administrative Agent, as applicable, or claims of the depositary bank arising by operation of law   or that the total amount of such funds is less than the amount required by the first sentence of this clause (g), the   Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the L/C Issuer and, in the case of clause of (B), the Administrative Agent,   pay to the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent, as applicable,, as additional funds to be deposited and held in the   deposit accounts designated by the L/C Issuer and, in the case of clause of (B), the Administrative Agent as   aforesaid, an amount equal to the excess of (x) 100% or 105%, as applicable, of such aggregate Outstanding Amount   over (y) the total amount of funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the L/C Issuer and, in the case of clause   of (B), the Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of   any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent   permitted under applicable Law, to reimburse the L/C Issuer. To the extent the amount of any Cash Collateral   exceeds 100% or 105%, as applicable, of the then Outstanding Amount of such L/C Obligations and so long as no   Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the Borrower.    (h) Applicability of ISP98 and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower   when a Letter of Credit is issued, (i) the rules of the \u201cInternational Standby Practices 1998\u201d published by the   Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version thereof as may be in effect at the time of   issuance) shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for   Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of Commerce (or such later version   thereof as may be in effect at the time of issuance) at the time of issuance shall apply to each commercial Letter of   Credit.       69      (i) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each   Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share a Letter of Credit fee for each Letter of Credit issued   equal to the Applicable Rate for Revolving Credit Loans that are Eurodollar Rate Loans times the daily maximum   amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Such letter of credit fees shall be computed from the   date of issuance thereof on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such letter of credit fees shall be due and payable on the last   Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the   issuance of such Letter of Credit and on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand.    (j) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay   directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit issued equal to   0.125% per annum of the daily maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Such   fronting fees shall be computed on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fees shall be due and payable on the   last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur   after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. In   addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation,   amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of     credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees not related to the fronting fee and standard costs and   charges are due and payable within five (5) Business Days of demand and are nonrefundable.    (k) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the   terms of any L/C Request or Letter of Credit Application, the terms of this Agreement shall control.    (l) Provisions Related to New Revolving Credit Commitments and Extended Revolving Credit Commitments. If   the maturity date in respect of any tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments occurs prior to the expiration of any   Letter of Credit, then (i) if one or more other tranches of Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of which the   maturity date shall not have occurred are then in effect, such Letters of Credit shall automatically be deemed to have   been issued (including for purposes of the obligations of the Revolving Credit Lenders to purchase participations   therein and to make Revolving Credit Loans and payments in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and (d))   under (and ratably participated in by Lenders pursuant to) the Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of such   non-terminating tranches up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of the unutilized   Revolving Credit Commitments thereunder at such time (it being understood that no partial face amount of any   Letter of Credit may be so reallocated) and (ii) to the extent not reallocated pursuant to immediately preceding   clause (i), the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize any such Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.03(g).   Commencing with the maturity date of any tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments, the sublimit for Letters of   Credit shall be agreed with the Lenders under the extended tranches.       70      Section 2.04 Swing Line Loans.    (a) The Swing Line. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the sole discretion of the Swing   Line Lender, the Swing Line Lender agrees to make loans (each such loan, a \u201cSwing Line Loan\u201d) to the Borrower   from time to time on any Business Day (other than the Closing Date) during the Revolving Credit Commitment   Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit,   notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding   Amount of Loans and L/C Obligations of the Lender acting as Swing Line Lender, may exceed the amount of such   Lender\u2019s Commitment; provided that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, the aggregate Outstanding Amount   of the Revolving Credit Loans of any Revolving Credit Lender, plus such Lender\u2019s Pro Rata Share of the   Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Lender\u2019s Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all   Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender\u2019s Revolving Credit Commitment; provided further that the   Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within   the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this   Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each Swing Line Loan shall be a   Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be   deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender an   unfunded risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Lender\u2019s Pro Rata   Share and the amount of such Swing Line Loan.    (b) Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the Borrower\u2019s irrevocable   written notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent. Each such notice must be received by the   Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall   specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, (ii) the requested borrowing date,   which shall be a Business Day and (iii) the account of the Borrower to be credited with the proceeds of such Swing   Line Borrowing. Each such telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and   the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a   Responsible Officer of the Borrower. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any Swing Line Loan   Notice, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (in writing) that the Administrative   Agent has also received such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the   Administrative Agent (in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (in   writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Credit Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m.   on the date of such proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A) directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing   Line Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (B) that   one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and     conditions hereof, the Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such   Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower. Notwithstanding   anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.04 or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Swing Line Lender shall   not be obligated to make any Swing Line Loan at a time when a Revolving Credit Lender is a Defaulting Lender   unless the Swing Line Lender has entered       71      into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the Swing Line Lender\u2019s risk with   respect to the Defaulting Lender\u2019s or Defaulting Lenders\u2019 participation in such Swing Line Loans, including by   Cash Collateralizing, or obtaining a backstop letter of credit from an issuer reasonably satisfactory to the Swing Line   Lender to support, such Defaulting Lender\u2019s or Defaulting Lenders\u2019 Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Swing Line   Loans.    (c) Refinancing of Swing Line Loans. The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute discretion   may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request   on its behalf), that each Revolving Credit Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender\u2019s Pro   Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Each such request shall be made in writing (which   written request shall be deemed to be a Committed Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the   requirements of Section 2.02(a), without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal   amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments   and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a copy of the   applicable Committed Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each   Revolving Credit Lender shall make an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such   Committed Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds for the account of the   Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent\u2019s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such   Committed Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes   funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The   Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.    (i) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Credit Borrowing   in accordance with Section 2.04(c), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as   set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line Lender that each of the Revolving Credit   Lenders fund its risk participation in such Swing Line Loan and each such Revolving Credit Lender\u2019s   payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)   shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation.    (ii) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account   of the Swing Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions   of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to   recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest   thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is   immediately available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Federal Funds   Rate from time to time in effect. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender (through the   Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (ii) shall be conclusive absent   manifest error.    (iii) Each Revolving Credit Lender\u2019s obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans or to purchase and   fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and   unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,       72      including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have   against the Swing Line Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the   occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar   to any of the foregoing; provided that each Revolving Credit Lender\u2019s obligation to make Revolving Credit   Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery     by the Borrower of a Committed Loan Notice). No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or   otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with interest as provided   herein.    (d) Repayment of Participations. At any time after any Revolving Credit Lender has purchased and funded a   risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing   Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share of such payment (appropriately   adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender\u2019s risk participation   was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.    (i) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing   Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described in   Section 10.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing Line Lender in its discretion),   each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Swing Line Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the   Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned,   at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such   demand upon the request of the Swing Line Lender.    (e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the   Borrower for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk   participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Lender\u2019s Pro Rata Share of any Swing Line Loan,   interest in respect of such Pro Rata Share shall be solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.    (f) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in   respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the Swing Line Lender.    (g) Provisions Related to New Revolving Credit Commitments and Extended Revolving Credit Commitments.   If the maturity date shall have occurred in respect of any tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments at a time when   another tranche or tranches of Revolving Credit Commitments is or are in effect with a longer maturity date, then on   the earliest occurring maturity date all then outstanding Swing Line Loans shall be repaid in full on such date (and   there shall be no adjustment to the participations in such Swing Line Loans as a result of the occurrence of such   maturity date); provided, however, that if on the occurrence of such earliest maturity date (after giving effect to any   repayments of Revolving Credit Loans and any reallocation of Letter of Credit participations as contemplated in   Section 2.03(l)), there shall exist sufficient unutilized Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or New Revolving   Credit Commitments so that the respective outstanding Swing Line Loans could be incurred pursuant the Extended   Revolving       73      Credit Commitments or New Revolving Credit Commitments which will remain in effect after the occurrence of   such maturity date, then there shall be an automatic adjustment on such date of the participations in such Swing Line   Loans and same shall be deemed to have been incurred solely pursuant to the relevant Extended Credit Revolving   Commitments or New Revolving Credit Commitments, and such Swing Line Loans shall not be so required to be   repaid in full on such earliest maturity date.    Section 2.05 Prepayments.    (a) Optional.    (i) The Borrower may, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent (a \u201cPrepayment Notice\u201d), at any time   or from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans made to the Borrower, in whole or in part without premium or penalty   except as described in clause (iv) below; provided, that (A) such notice must be received by the Administrative   Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., (1) three (3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate   Loans and (2) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (B) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be   in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof; and (C) any prepayment of   Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $250,000 or a whole multiple of $50,000 in excess thereof or, in   each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and   amount of such prepayment and the Class(es) and Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid. The Administrative Agent will     promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender\u2019s Pro   Rata Share of such prepayment. The Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in   such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan shall   be accompanied by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to   Section 2.05(a)(iv) and Section 3.05. Each prepayment of the Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05(a) shall be applied   among the Facilities in such amounts as the Borrower may direct in its sole discretion and, in the case of the Term   Loan Facilities, in direct order of maturity or as otherwise directed by the Borrower. Other than as set forth in   Section 10.07(l), each prepayment made by the Borrower in respect of a particular Facility shall be paid to the   Administrative Agent for the account of (and to be promptly disbursed to) the Appropriate Lenders in accordance   with their respective Pro Rata Shares.    (ii) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at   any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty;   provided, that (A) such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not later   than 11:00 a.m. on the date of the prepayment, and (B) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal   amount of $100,000. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given   by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall   be due and payable on the date specified therein.    (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Borrower may rescind any   notice of prepayment under Section 2.05(a)(i) or Section 2.05(a)(ii) if such prepayment would have resulted from   (A) a refinancing of all of the Facilities, (B) issuance       74      of New Term Loans and/or New Revolving Credit Commitments, which refinancing or issuance shall not be   consummated or shall otherwise be delayed or (C) the refinancing of all or a portion of the Facilities with Credit   Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness, which refinancing shall not be consummated or shall otherwise be delayed.    (iv) At the time of the effectiveness of any Repricing Transaction that (x) makes any prepayment of Term   Loans or Revolving Credit Loans (with a corresponding reduction of Revolving Credit Commitments) in connection   with any Repricing Transaction, or (y) effects any amendment of this Agreement resulting in a Repricing   Transaction and is consummated prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Borrower agrees to pay to the   Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of each applicable Lender, a fee in an amount equal to, (I) in the case   of clause (x), a prepayment premium of 1% of the amount of the Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans (with a   corresponding reduction of Revolving Credit Commitments) being prepaid and (II) in the case of clause (y), a   payment equal to 1% of the aggregate amount of the applicable Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments   outstanding immediately prior to such amendment. Such fees shall be due and payable upon the date of the   effectiveness of such Repricing Transaction.    (b) Mandatory.    (i) Within five (5) Business Days after financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(a)   and the related Compliance Certificate has been delivered pursuant to Section 6.02(b), the Borrower shall cause to   be prepaid an aggregate principal amount of Term Loans in an amount equal to (A) 50% of Excess Cash Flow, if   any, for the fiscal year of the Borrower covered by such financial statements (commencing with the fiscal year of the   Borrower ending December 31, 2011) minus (B) the sum of (1) the amount of any voluntary prepayments of Term   Loans made pursuant to Section 2.05(a) during such fiscal year other than prepayments made with the Net Cash   Proceeds from the incurrence of Credit Agreement Refinancing Indebtedness and (2) solely to the extent the amount   of the Revolving Credit Commitments are permanently reduced pursuant to ","Section 6.07":"Section 6.07 Maintenance of Insurance.

(vi) Except for any prepayments pursuant to Section 10.07(l) (which shall in each case be applied as provided   in such Section, subject to Section 2.14 with respect to any New Term Loans and Section 2.16 with respect to any   Other Term Loans), (A) each prepayment of Term Loans of any Class pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be   applied, first, in direct order of maturities, to the principal repayment installments of such Term Loans due within 12   months of such prepayment, second, on a pro rata basis to the other principal repayment installments of       77      such Term Loans other than the principal payment due on the Maturity Date and third, to the principal payment on   the Maturity Date of such Term Loans; and unless otherwise provided herein, each such prepayment shall be paid to   the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares (prior to giving effect to any rejection by any Term   Lender of any such prepayment pursuant to clause (vii) below), subject to clause (vii) of this Section 2.05(b) and   (B) on and after the borrowing of any New Term Loans or Other Term Loans, the prepayments referred to in this   Section 2.05(b) shall be allocated among each Class of Term Loans pro rata based on the aggregate outstanding   principal amount of the Term Loans of each such Class unless otherwise agreed among the Borrower and the New   Term Loan Lenders in accordance with Section 2.14(e)(v) or the Borrower and the lenders providing Other Term   Loans in accordance with Section 2.16 (it being understood that, in either case, the Term B Loans shall not be   allocated any less than such Classes\u2019 pro rata share of such prepayment).    (vii) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any mandatory prepayment of Term   Loans required to be made pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) of this Section 2.05(b) at least five (5) Business Days   prior to the date of such prepayment. Each such notice shall specify the date of such prepayment and provide a   reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify   each Appropriate Lender of the contents of any such prepayment notice and of such Appropriate Lender\u2019s Pro Rata   Share of the prepayment. Any Term Lender (a \u201cDeclining Lender\u201d, and any Term Lender which is not a Declining     Lender, an \u201cAccepting Lender\u201d) may elect, by delivering not less than four (4) Business Days prior to the proposed   prepayment date, a written notice (such notice, a \u201cRejection Notice\u201d) that any mandatory prepayment otherwise   required to be made with respect to the Term Loans held by such Term Lender pursuant to clauses (i) through (v) of   this Section 2.05(b) not be made, in which event the portion of such prepayment which would otherwise have been   applied to the Term Loans of the Declining Lenders shall instead be retained by the Borrower (for itself and on   behalf of its Restricted Subsidiaries). If a Term Lender fails to deliver a Rejection Notice within the time frame   specified above, any such failure will be deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such mandatory prepayment   of Term Loans.    (viii) If the Escrow Release Date shall not have occurred by 2:00 p.m. on December 21, 2010 (the \u201cSpecial   Mandatory Prepayment Date\u201d), the Initial Borrower shall cause the Escrow Agent to repay all Term Loans   outstanding on the Special Mandatory Prepayment Date at 100% of the aggregate principal amount thereof minus   the Term B Closing Date Funding Fee, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount so prepaid from the   Closing Date up to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Prepayment Date.

Notwithstanding any of the other   provisions of this Section 2.05(b), so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, if any   prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans is required to be made under this Section 2.05(b), other than on the last day of   the Interest Period therefor, the Borrower may, in its sole discretion, deposit the amount of any such prepayment   otherwise required to be made thereunder into a Cash Collateral Account until the last day of such Interest Period, at   which time the Administrative Agent shall be authorized (without any further action by or notice to or from the   Borrower or any other Loan       78      Party) to apply such amount to the prepayment of such Loans in accordance with this Section 2.05(b). Upon the   occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Administrative Agent shall also be authorized   (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Loan Party) to apply such amount to   the prepayment of the outstanding Loans in accordance with this Section 2.05(b).

(b) If any Lender reasonably determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or any   change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender (or   its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any   corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender\u2019s obligations hereunder (taking into   consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender\u2019s desired return on capital), then from   time to time upon written demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of   such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with   Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for   such reduction.    (c) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves   with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits, additional interest on   the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such   Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive in the   absence of manifest error), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio   requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in   respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurodollar Rate Loans, such additional costs   (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal   to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good   faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) which in each case shall be due and payable on   each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; provided the Borrower shall have received at least fifteen   (15) days\u2019 prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or cost from such     Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice fifteen (15) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional   interest or cost shall be due and payable fifteen (15) days from receipt of such notice.    (d) If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 3.04, then such Lender will, if requested by the   Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Lending Office for any Loan or Letter of Credit   affected by such event or to assign its rights and obligations with respect to such Loan or Letter of Credit to another   of its offices, branches or affiliates; provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of   such Lender, cause such Lender and its Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory   disadvantage, and provided further that nothing in this Section 3.04(d) shall affect or       100      postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 3.04(a),   Section 3.04(b) or Section 3.04(c).    ","Section 3.03":"Section 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and   reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a   proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a   proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan,   or that Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable   amount and the Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the   Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans   shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such   notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to   or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a   request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.    ","Section 3.02":"Section 3.02 Illegality. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any   Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make,   maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate,   then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such   Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be   suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise   to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such   Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of   such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully   continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully   continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also   pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending     Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such   Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

(b) If any Lender reasonably determines that the introduction of any Law regarding capital adequacy or any   change therein or in the interpretation thereof, in each case after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender (or   its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or any   corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of such Lender\u2019s obligations hereunder (taking into   consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender\u2019s desired return on capital), then from   time to time upon written demand of such Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the charge and the calculation of   such reduced rate of return (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent given in accordance with   Section 3.06), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for   such reduction.    (c) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves   with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits, additional interest on   the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such   Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive in the   absence of manifest error), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio   requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in   respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurodollar Rate Loans, such additional costs   (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal   to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good   faith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) which in each case shall be due and payable on   each date on which interest is payable on such Loan; provided the Borrower shall have received at least fifteen   (15) days\u2019 prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or cost from such     Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice fifteen (15) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional   interest or cost shall be due and payable fifteen (15) days from receipt of such notice.    (d) If any Lender requests compensation under this Section 3.04, then such Lender will, if requested by the   Borrower, use commercially reasonable efforts to designate another Lending Office for any Loan or Letter of Credit   affected by such event or to assign its rights and obligations with respect to such Loan or Letter of Credit to another   of its offices, branches or affiliates; provided that such efforts are made on terms that, in the reasonable judgment of   such Lender, cause such Lender and its Lending Office(s) to suffer no material economic, legal or regulatory   disadvantage, and provided further that nothing in this Section 3.04(d) shall affect or       100      postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrower or the rights of such Lender pursuant to Section 3.04(a),   Section 3.04(b) or Section 3.04(c).

Upon demand of any Lender from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly   compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result   of:    (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day   other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of   acceleration, or otherwise); or    (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay,   borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the   Borrower;    including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such   Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.    For purposes of calculating amounts payable by a Borrower to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each   Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan   by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and   for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded. A certificate of such   Lender submitted to the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to   any amounts owing under this Section 3.05 shall be conclusive absent manifest error.    Section 3.06 Matters Applicable to All Requests for Compensation.    (a) Any Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this  3 shall deliver a certificate to the   Borrower setting forth in reasonable detail the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder, which shall   be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
